/**
 * Filter that wraps the response with one capable of buffering on command.
 * <p>
 * The response wrapper is additionally make available as a request attribute, so it's always obtainable even if a following filter
 * wraps the response again. By default the response wrapper is in "pass-through" mode, meaning it will do no buffering. Anywhere during the
 * request it can be switched to buffer by setting its <code>passThrough</code> argument to false.
 * <p>
 * The next call to obtain the response's writer will then provide one that buffers. Do note that any existing writer that has been obtained
 * before <code>passThrough</code> was set to false and is used afterwards, will <b>not</b> automatically start buffering. Only newly obtained
 * writers will buffer from that point on.
 * <p>
 * If at the end of the request, when this filter resumes control again, the response is still buffering (<code>passThrough</code> is false)
 * its buffer will be automatically flushed to the underlying response. If however the buffer is not empty, but <code>passThrough</code> is true,
 * no such flushing will be done and it's assumed the application has taken care of this.
