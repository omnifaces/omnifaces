/**
 * <p>
 * This package contains the classes for the OmniFaces FacesViews feature.
 *
 * <h3>Introduction</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * FacesViews is a feature where a special dedicated directory (<code>/WEB-INF/faces-views</code>), or optionally one or
 * more user specified directories, can be used to store Facelets source files.
 *
 * <p>
 * All files found in these directories are automatically mapped as Facelets files and made available using both their
 * original extension as well as without an extension (extensionless). Optionally scanning can be restricted to include
 * only certain extensions.
 *
 * <p>
 * With FacesViews, there is thus no need to list all Facelets views that should be accessed without an extension in
 * some configuration file. Additionally, it thus automatically maps Facelets files to their original file extension,
 * which prevents exposing the source code of those Facelets that happens with the default JSF mapping.
 *
 * <p>
 * Scanning is done automatically and thus no further configuration is needed. The feature is compatible with
 * applications that don't have <code>web.xml</code> or <code>faces-config.xml</code> configuration files. As such, it
 * can be used as an alternative to declaring the {@link javax.faces.webapp.FacesServlet} in <code>web.xml</code> for
 * the <code>.xhtml</code> to <code>.xhtml</code> mapping.
 *
 * <h4>Example 1:</h4>
 *
 * <p>
 * Consider the following file structure and assume no further configuration has been done:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   /WEB-INF/faces-views/index.xhtml
 *   /WEB-INF/faces-views/users/add.xhtml
 *   /normal.xhtml
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * This will make the Facelets available via the following URLs
 * (given a root deployment on domain <code>example.com</code>):
 *
 * <pre>
 *   example.com/index
 *   example.com/users/add
 *   example.com/index.xhtml (will redirect to /index by default)
 *   example.com/users/add.xhtml (will redirect to /users/add by default)
 *   example.com/normal.xhtml
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that although the directory outside <code>/WEB-INF/faces-views</code> is not scanned, the
 * {@link javax.faces.webapp.FacesServlet} <em>is</em> mapped on all extensions found in
 * <code>/WEB-INF/faces-views</code>, so this will also affect files outside this directory. In the above example
 * <code>normal.xhtml</code> is thus also available via the <code>.xhtml</code> extension, since the whole FacesServlet
 * is mapped on this.
 *
 * <p>
 * Also note that the extension variants of the scanned views will redirect to the extensionless variants. This behavior
 * can be changed (see below), so that these views are either directly available (no redirect) or are not available at
 * all.
 *
 * <h4>Example 2:</h4>
 *
 * <p>
 * Consider the following <code>web.xml</code>:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   &lt;context-param&gt;
 *       &lt;param-name&gt;org.omnifaces.FACES_VIEWS_SCAN_PATHS&lt;/param-name&gt;
 *       &lt;param-value&gt;/*.xhtml&lt;/param-value&gt;
 *   &lt;/context-param&gt;
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * And this file structure:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   /page1.xhtml
 *   /foo/page2.xhtml
 *   /WEB-INF/resources/template.xhtml
 *   /script.js
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * This will make the Facelets available via the following URLs
 * (given a root deployment on domain <code>example.com</code>):
 *
 * <pre>
 *   example.com/page1
 *   example.com/foo/page2
 *   example.com/page1.xhtml (will redirect to /page1 by default)
 *   example.com/foo/page2.xhtml (will redirect to /foo/page2 by default)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that in the above example, <code>/WEB-INF</code> was NOT scanned and thus <code>template.xhtml</code> is not
 * made publicly available. Likewise <code>/script.js</code> was also not scanned since it doesn't have the configured
 * extension (<code>.xhtml</code>). Finally, although a <code>web.xml</code> was used, there does not need to be a
 * mapping for the <code>FacesServlet</code> in it.
 *
 * <h4>Example 3:</h4>
 *
 * <p>
 * Consider the following <code>web.xml</code>:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   &lt;context-param&gt;
 *       &lt;param-name&gt;org.omnifaces.FACES_VIEWS_SCAN_PATHS&lt;/param-name&gt;
 *       &lt;param-value&gt;/*.xhtml/*&lt;/param-value&gt;
 *   &lt;/context-param&gt;
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * And this file structure:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   /page1.xhtml
 *   /foo/page2.xhtml
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * This will make the Facelets available via the following URLs
 * (given a root deployment on domain <code>example.com</code>):
 *
 * <pre>
 *   example.com/page1
 *   example.com/foo/page2
 *   example.com/page1/foo/bar (will forward to /page1 with dynamic path parameters "foo" and "bar")
 *   example.com/foo/page2/bar (will forward to /foo/page2 with dynamic path parameter "bar")
 *   example.com/page1.xhtml (will redirect to /page1 by default)
 *   example.com/foo/page2.xhtml (will redirect to /foo/page2 by default)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * The path parameters are injectable via <code>&#64;</code>{@link org.omnifaces.cdi.Param} in the managed bean
 * associated with the page. Below example shows how they are injected in the managed bean associated with /page1.xhtml.
 *
 * <pre>
 *   &#64;Inject &#64;Param(pathIndex=0)
 *   private String foo;
 *
 *   &#64;Inject &#64;Param(pathIndex=1)
 *   private String bar;
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * The support for this feature was added in OmniFaces 2.5 and is not available in older versions.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Welcome files</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * If a <code>&lt;welcome-file&gt;</code> is defined in <code>web.xml</code> that's scanned by FacesViews
 * <strong>AND</strong> <code>REDIRECT_TO_EXTENSIONLESS</code> is used (which is the default, see below), it's necessary
 * to define an extensionless welcome file to prevent a request to <code>/</code> being redirected to
 * <code>/[welcome file]</code>. E.g. without this <code>http://example.com</code> will redirect to say
 * <code>http://example.com/index</code>.
 *
 * <p>
 * For example:
 *
 * <pre>
 *    &lt;welcome-file-list&gt;
 *        &lt;welcome-file&gt;index&lt;/welcome-file&gt;
 *    &lt;/welcome-file-list&gt;
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>Dispatch methods</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * JSF normally inspects the request URI to derive a logical view id from it. It assumes the FacesServlet is either
 * mapped on a prefix path or an extension, and will get confused when an extensionless "exactly mapped" request is
 * encountered. To counter this, FacesViews makes use of a filter that intercepts each request and makes it appear to
 * JSF that the request was a normal extension mapped one.
 *
 * <p>
 * In order to do this dispatching, two methods are provided; forwarding, and wrapping the request and continuing the
 * filter chain. For the last method to work, the FacesServlet is programmatically mapped to every individual resource
 * (page/view) that is encountered. By default the filter is automatically registered and is inserted <b>after</b> all
 * filters that are declared in <code>web.xml</code>.
 *
 * <p>
 * These internal details are important for users to be aware of, since they greatly influence how extensionless
 * requests interact with other filter based functionality such as security filters, compression filters, file upload
 * filters, etc.
 *
 * <p>
 * With the forwarding method, filters typically have to be set to dispatch type <code>FORWARD</code> as well. If the
 * FacesViews filter is the first in the chain other filters that are set to dispatch type <code>REQUEST</code> will
 * <strong>NOT</strong> be invoked at all (the chain is ended). If the FacesViews filter is set to be the last, other
 * filters will be invoked, but they should not modify the response (a forward clears the response buffer till so far
 * if not committed).
 *
 * <p>
 * No such problems appear to exist when the FacesViews filter simply continues the filtering chain. However, since it
 * wraps the requess there might be unforeseen problems with containers or other filters that get confused when the
 * request URI changes in the middle of the chain. Continuing the chain has been tested with JBoss EAP 6.0.1, GlassFish
 * 3.1.2.2, WebLogic 12.1.1 and TomEE 1.5.2-snapshot and thus with both Mojarra and MyFaces. However, since it's a new
 * method for OmniFaces 1.4 we kept the existing forward as an alternative.
 *
 * <p>
 * The configuration options below provide more details about the dispatch methods and the filter position which can be
 * used for tweaking FacesViews for interoperability with other filters.
 *
 * <h3>Configuration</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * The following context parameters are available.
 *
 * <table summary="All available context parameters" border="1" cellspacing="0">
 *
 * <tr>
 * <td class="colFirst"><code>{@value org.omnifaces.facesviews.FacesViews#FACES_VIEWS_ENABLED_PARAM_NAME}</code></td>
 * <td>Used to completely switch scanning off.
 * <br>Allowed values: {<code>true</code>,<code>false</code>}
 * <br>Default value: <code>true</code>
 * <br>(note that if no <code>/WEB-INF/faces-views</code> directory is present and no explicit paths have been configured, no scanning will be done either)</td>
 * </tr>
 *
 * <tr>
 * <td class="colFirst"><code>{@value org.omnifaces.facesviews.FacesViews#FACES_VIEWS_SCAN_PATHS_PARAM_NAME}</code></td>
 * <td>A comma separated list of paths that are to be scanned in addition to <code>/WEB-INF/faces-views</code>.
 * <br>Allowed values: any path relative to the web root, including the root path (<code>/</code>) and <code>/WEB-INF</code>.
 * A wildcard can be added to the path, which will cause only files with the given extension te be scanned.
 * <br>Examples:
 * <br>- Scan all files in both folder1 and folder2: <code>/folder1, /folder2</code>
 * <br>- Scan only .xhtml files in the root: <code>/*.xhtml</code>
 * <br>Note that when the root path is given, all its sub paths are also scanned EXCEPT <code>WEB-INF</code>, <code>META-INF</code> and <code>resources</code>.
 * If those have to be scanned as well, they can be added to the list of paths explicitly.
 * <br>Default value: <code>/WEB-INF/faces-views</code> (note when this value is set, those paths will be in addition to the default <code>/WEB-INF/faces-views</code>)
 * </td>
 * </tr>
 *
 * <tr>
 * <td class="colFirst"><code>{@value org.omnifaces.facesviews.FacesViews#FACES_VIEWS_SCANNED_VIEWS_EXTENSIONLESS_PARAM_NAME}</code></td>
 * <td>Used to set how scanned views should be rendered in JSF controlled links.
 * With this setting set to <code>false</code>, it depends on whether the request URI uses an extension or not.
 * If it doesn't, links are also rendered without one, otherwise they are rendered with an extension.
 * When set to <code>true</code> links are always rendered without an extension.
 * <br>Default value: <code>true</code>
 * </td>
 * </tr>
 *
 * <tr>
 * <td class="colFirst"><code>{@value org.omnifaces.facesviews.FacesViews#FACES_VIEWS_EXTENSION_ACTION_PARAM_NAME}</code></td>
 * <td>Determines the action that is performed whenever a resource is requested WITH extension that's also available without an extension.
 * <br>Allowed values are enumerated in {@link org.omnifaces.facesviews.ExtensionAction}, which have the following meaning:
 * <br>- <code>REDIRECT_TO_EXTENSIONLESS</code>: Send a 301 (permanent) redirect to the same URL, but with the extension removed. E.g. <code>/foo.xhtml</code> redirects to <code>/foo</code>.
 * <br>- <code>SEND_404</code>: Send a 404 (not found), makes it look like e.g. <code>/foo.xhtml</code> never existed and there's only <code>/foo</code>.
 * <br>- <code>PROCEED</code>: No special action is taken. Both <code>/foo.xhtml</code> and <code>/foo</code> are processed as-if they were separate views (with same content).
 * <br>Default value: <code>REDIRECT_TO_EXTENSIONLESS</code>
 * </td>
 * </tr>
 *
 * <tr>
 * <td class="colFirst"><code>{@value org.omnifaces.facesviews.FacesViews#FACES_VIEWS_PATH_ACTION_PARAM_NAME}</code></td>
 * <td>Determines the action that is performed whenever a resource is requested in a public path that has been used for scanning views by faces views
 * (e.g. the paths set by <code>{@value org.omnifaces.facesviews.FacesViews#FACES_VIEWS_SCAN_PATHS_PARAM_NAME}</code>, but excluding the root path /).
 * <br>Allowed values are enumerated in {@link org.omnifaces.facesviews.PathAction}, which have the following meaning:
 * <br>- <code>SEND_404</code>: Send a 404 (not found), makes it look like e.g. <code>/path/foo.xhtml</code> never existed and there's only <code>/foo</code> and optionally <code>/foo.xhtml</code>.
 * <br>- <code>REDIRECT_TO_SCANNED_EXTENSIONLESS</code>: Send a 301 (permanent) redirect to the resource corresponding with the one that was scanned. E.g. <code>/path/foo.xml</code> redirects to <code>/foo</code>.
 * <br>- <code>PROCEED</code>: No special action is taken. <code>/path/foo.xml</code> and <code>/foo</code> (and optionally <code>/foo.xhtml</code>) will be accessible.
 * <br>Default value: <code>SEND_404</code>
 * </td>
 * </tr>
 *
 * <tr>
 * <td class="colFirst"><code>{@value org.omnifaces.facesviews.FacesViews#FACES_VIEWS_FILTER_AFTER_DECLARED_FILTERS_PARAM_NAME}</code></td>
 * <td>Used to set whether the {@link org.omnifaces.facesviews.FacesViewsForwardingFilter} should match before declared filters (<code>false</code>) or
 * after declared filters (<code>true</code>).
 * <br>Default value: <code>false</code> (the FacesViews forwarding filter is the first in the filter chain)
