/**
 * This wraps a request to an extensionless JSF view and provides an extension for
 * all methods that reveal the servlet path. Additional the path info is set to null.
 * <p>
 * This is needed since JSF implementations inspect the request to determine if a
 * prefix (path) or suffix (extension) mapping was used. If the request is neither
 * (in effect, an "exact and extensionless mapping), JSF will get confused and not
 * be able to derive view IDs etc correctly.
 * <p>
