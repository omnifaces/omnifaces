/**
 * <p>
 * The CDI annotation <code>&#64;</code>{@link Eager} specifies that a scoped bean is to be eagerly instantiated.
 * <p>
 * JSF's own native managed beans are being deprecated in favor of CDI managed beans. One feature that those native JSF
 * managed beans had that's not directly available for CDI managed beans is the ability to eagerly instantiate
 * application scoped beans.
 * <p>
 * OmniFaces fills this void and even goes one step further by introducing the <code>@Eager</code> annotation
 * that can be applied to <code>@RequestScoped</code>, <code>@ViewScoped</code>,
 * <code>@SessionScoped</code> and <code>@ApplicationScoped</code> beans. This causes these beans to be instantiated
 * automatically at the start of each such scope instead of on demand when a bean is first referenced.
 * <p>
 * In case of <code>@RequestScoped</code> and <code>@ViewScoped</code> beans instantiation happens per request URI / view
 * and an extra attribute is required for specifying this.
 *
 * <h3>Supported scopes</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * Currently supported scopes:
 * <ol>
 * <li> CDI {@link RequestScoped}
 * <li> CDI {@link javax.faces.view.ViewScoped}
 * <li> OmniFaces {@link ViewScoped}
 * <li> CDI {@link SessionScoped}
 * <li> CDI {@link ApplicationScoped}
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h3>Usage</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * E.g.
 * The following bean will be instantiated during application's startup:
 * <pre>
 * &#64;Eager
 * &#64;ApplicationScoped
 * public class MyEagerApplicationScopedBean {
 *
 *     &#64;PostConstruct
 *     public void init() {
 *         System.out.println("Application scoped init!");
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * <em>Note: you can also use the stereotype <code>&#64;</code>{@link Startup} for this instead.</em>
 * <p>
 * The following bean will be instantiated whenever a session is created:
 * <pre>
 * &#64;Eager
 * &#64;SessionScoped
 * public class MyEagerSessionScopedBean implements Serializable {
 *
 *     private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
 *
 *     &#64;PostConstruct
 *     public void init() {
 *         System.out.println("Session scoped init!");
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * The following bean will be instantiated whenever the URI <code>/components/cache</code> (relatively to the
 * application root) is requested, i.e. when an app is deployed to <code>/myapp</code> at localhost this will correspond to
 * a URL like <code>http://localhost:8080/myapp/components/cache</code>:
 * <pre>
 * &#64;Eager(requestURI = "/components/cache")
 * &#64;RequestScoped
 * public class MyEagerRequestScopedBean {
 *
 *     &#64;PostConstruct
 *     public void init() {
 *         System.out.println("/components/cache requested");
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3><code>FacesContext</code> in <code>&#64;PostConstruct</code></h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * When using <code>&#64;Eager</code> or <code>&#64;Eager(requestURI)</code>, be aware that the {@link FacesContext} is
 * <strong>not</strong> available in the <code>&#64;PostConstruct</code>. Reason is, the {@link FacesServlet} isn't
 * invoked yet at the moment <code>&#64;Eager</code> bean is constructed. Only in <code>&#64;Eager(viewId)</code>, the
 * {@link FacesContext} is available in the <code>&#64;PostConstruct</code>.
 * <p>
 * In case you need information from {@link HttpServletRequest}, {@link HttpSession} and/or {@link ServletContext}, then
 * you can just <code>&#64;Inject</code> it right away. Also, all other CDI managed beans are available the usual way
 * via <code>&#64;Inject</code>, as long as they do also not depend on {@link FacesContext} in their
 * <code>&#64;PostConstruct</code>.
