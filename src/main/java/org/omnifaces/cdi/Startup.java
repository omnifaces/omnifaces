/**
 * <p>
 * Stereo type that designates a bean as an eagerly instantiated bean with application scope.
 * Watch out with IDE autocomplete on import that you don't accidentally import EJB's one.
 * <pre>
 * import org.omnifaces.cdi.Startup;
 *
 * &#64;Startup
 * public class MyStartupBean {}
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * In effect, this annotation does exactly the same as:
 * <pre>
 * import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
 * import org.omnifaces.cdi.Eager;
 *
 * &#64;Eager
 * &#64;ApplicationScoped
 * public class MyStartupBean {}
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * This bean type effectively functions as a CDI based startup listener for the web application.
 * <p>
 * Note that Java EE thus also provides the <code>javax.ejb.Startup</code> and <code>javax.ejb.Singleton</code>
 * annotations which together provide similar functionality, but it requires an EJB dependency (which may not be
 * applicable on e.g. Tomcat+Weld) and it will result in the bean annotated with these annotations to become an EJB
 * session bean (with automatic transaction management and automatic locking which you might need to turn off with yet
 * more additional <code>javax.ejb.TransactionAttribute</code> and <code>javax.ejb.Lock</code> annotations if these are
 * not appropriate for some situation).
